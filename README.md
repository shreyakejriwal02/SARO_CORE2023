# Search and Research Optimization (SARO)
SARO is a search and rescue decision support system for estimating survival rate based on fragility curve based building model and thus efficiently allocating and scheduling resources in this case the rescue teams.

## Overview
In the aftermath of natural disasters like earthquakes, the efficient management of Search and Rescue operations is crucial. Injured people are in need of medical assistance, and time is of the essence, and there are not enough rescue teams for all people in distress. Accurate decision making is challenging given the limited time, resources and chaotic environment. ‘Saro’ is a Decision Support System Tool designed to address or prevent the challenges discussed in the previous page. It helps analyse the situation and make quick computational decisions, creating plans to allocate rescue teams of multiple organizations like Police and Firefighters, Task forces, Urban Search and Rescue Teams, and Volunteers, to various sites of action. The tool also prescribes an optimal sequence of allocation efforts for each team, in order to maximise the number of lives that can be saved, working to achieve the overarching goal:  

> "Minimize loss of life, alleviate suffering and prevent harm by more efficiently locating, rescuing and providing aid to individuals affected by the disaster."
